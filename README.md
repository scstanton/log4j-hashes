To mitigate CVE-2021-44228: 

In releases >=2.10, this behavior can be mitigated by setting either the system property log4j2.formatMsgNoLookups or the environment variable LOG4J_FORMAT_MSG_NO_LOOKUPS to true. 

For releases from 2.0-beta9 to 2.10.0, the mitigation is to remove the JndiLookup class from the classpath: 

zip -q -d log4j-core-*.jar org/apache/logging/log4j/core/lookup/JndiLookup.class.‚Äù
